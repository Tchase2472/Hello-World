# Todd Chase Code
I have had this repository for the last 4 years apparently. I am now finding some use for it. There are some examples of code here from some of the projects I have built.  
The struggle continues, like a never-ending pledge initiation by a fraternity from hell. A part of me feels that the more routine torments of the netherworld are somehow preferable to the endless tutorials, the mis-direction, and constant emphasis on convolutions and technical double-speak. We, as Dante before us, will continue forward through this inhospitable land gaining an understanding of the technollogically damned until we, at last, can join them.
